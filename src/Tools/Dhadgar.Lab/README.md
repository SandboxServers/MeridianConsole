# meridian-lab

Dev and lab only, never production. `meridian-lab` is a local tool that drives the Meridian product services and agents on a developer machine or a lab host so their behaviour can be tested end to end. Nothing in this folder is deployed, referenced by a product project, or shipped in a container image. `LabIsolationTests` enforces that.

## Layout

- `LabProgram.cs`: entry point (`meridian-lab`).
- `LabDefaults.cs`, `LabPorts.cs`, `LabIds.cs`, `LabPaths.cs`, `LabHosts.cs`: constants, ports, identifiers, path rules and the loopback host guard.
- `Daemon/`: the loopback daemon that exposes the lab over HTTP with a bearer token.
- `Policy/`: `LabGate`, the policy check every tool call passes through.
- `Tools/`: `LabCallContext`, the per-call context.
- `Audit/`: `LabEvent` and the event sink.
- `Secrets/`: `SecretVault`, which holds secrets by reference only.
- `Nodes/`: the adapter into the Nodes product (`INodesLabAdapter`, `NodesLabAdapter`, `EnrollProbe`).

## Rules

- The daemon binds to loopback only and requires a bearer token. Host and Origin headers are checked.
- Secrets are referenced by name, never printed or returned as plain text.
- Paths from any input go through `LabPaths` before use.
- Processes are started with `ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList`.
