# Contributing

## Suggested flow
- Branch from `develop`
- Open PRs into `develop`
- Keep PRs small; include tests when reasonable

## Repo conventions
- Message contracts live in `src/Shared/Dhadgar.Contracts`
- Avoid breaking changes to published contracts; evolve additively
- Each service owns its data and migrations
