# CodeRabbit Test

This is a test file to verify that CodeRabbit is working correctly after the workflow fix.

## Test Changes

- Fixed GITHUB_TOKEN passing from `with:` to `env:`
- Updated permissions from `read` to `write` for pull-requests
- This PR should trigger CodeRabbit to post a review

## Expected Behavior

CodeRabbit should:
1. Analyze this PR automatically
2. Post a review comment with suggestions
3. Complete without errors

If you see this, CodeRabbit is working! 🎉
